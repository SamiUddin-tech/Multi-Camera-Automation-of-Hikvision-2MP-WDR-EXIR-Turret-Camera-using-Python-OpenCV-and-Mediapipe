# Multi-Camera-Automation-of-Hikvision-2MP-WDR-EXIR-Turret-Camera-using-Python-OpenCV-and-Mediapipe
Automating and enhancing surveillance setup with this Python-based solution for controlling and analyzing multiple Hikvision 2MP WDR EXIR Turret Cameras simultaneously using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time video analysis.

## Equipment Used in This Project

In this project, I utilize specific tools and technologies to achieve our goals effectively. Here's a breakdown of the essential equipment and software used:

**1. 3 X [Hikvision 2MP WDR EXIR Turret Camera with 2.8mm Fixed Lens](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1302494-REG/hikvision_ds_2ce56d7t_it3_2_8mm_ds_2ce56d7t_it3_outdoor_ir_turret.html):** These high-quality surveillance cameras are the backbone of our project. They provide clear and detailed video footage for analysis and automation.

**2. Python Programming Language:** Python serves as our programming language of choice. Its versatility and extensive libraries make it ideal for building robust automation and computer vision solutions.

**3. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library):** OpenCV is a powerful open-source library that aids in image and video processing. We leverage its features for tasks like real-time video analysis and object detection.

**4. MediaPipe:** MediaPipe is a framework developed by Google that facilitates the implementation of various machine learning-based applications, including gesture recognition, face detection, and pose estimation. It 
enhances our project's capabilities.

**5. Computer Hardware:** A computer or server running the project software is essential for real-time camera control and analysis.

**6. Operating System:** The project is designed to work on multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, providing flexibility in deployment.
